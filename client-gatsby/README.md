# Dapp blockchain based rewards system with Ethereum

This is a Dapp (decentralized application) sample implementation of a rewards system using blockchain and ethereum network, available for studying. 

The frontend application was forked and adapted using the repository [e-shop](https://github.com/james-muriithi/e-shop).

![redeem](/doc/redeem.png)

## Features

- Metamask integration using web3.js
- Creates a fake cryptocurrency (technically a token), using symbol CEM (refers to my last name "Cembranelli"), following [ERC-20](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/) token standard

### For Partners:
- Allows administrator to register new partners that will be joining the reward program
- Allows administrator to define the partner points balance
- Apply points reconciliation logic during the redeem process (**TBD: No logic implemented currently**)
### For Members:
- Allows member to reedem products based on his wallet account balance
- Allows administrator to issue points (tokens) to the members

## Stack

- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/): This comes with a development environment, a testing framework, and a development blockchain.
- Solidity: used to develop the smart contracts.
- [Web3.js](): A library for interacting with metamask and deployed smart contracts on the frontend.
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache): A development blockchain for deploying smart contracts and inspecting state during development,
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): A framework for building user interfaces.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): A wallet for user private keys management.

## Architecture Overview

![arch](/doc/Reward_blockchain_partner.png)

## ðŸš€ Quick start

> Install

To be able to run this app, youâ€™ll need to have:

- Node.js.
- Truffle.
- Ganache development blockchain.
- Metamask chrome extension.

Note that we wonâ€™t need real Ether tokens as we will be using test Ether tokens from our development blockchain (Ganache).

> Before you run the application

1) Start your Ganache blockchain


![ganache](/doc/ganache.png)

2) Deploy the smart contract

Go to the root folder and run:

```
truffle migrate
```

This contract will create the token (CEM) with an initial total supply of 1 milion. It will then transfer this amount to the administrator account.

The contract will also:

- register 2 new partners, using the first 2 accounts on the Ganache blockchain.
- issue tokens (100 CEM) to users (accounts), using the 3rd and 4th addressesd on the Ganache blockchain. The users then can use the tokens to reedem products.

Note: copy the partners and members addresses to setup the issue-token.js script, as shown later in this tutorial.


3) Setup the administrator account

Update the app administrator account on the file src/data/defaultAccountConfig.js, using the first Ganache account:

```
export const config = 
    {
        adminAccount: "[put here your admin account]"
    }
```

The administrator account will be responsible for issuing tokens to the users redeem the products. 

4) Setup partners and members (users) to earn points

Update the user accounts on the file src/contracts/issue-token.js with the 2 first accounts on the Ganache:

```
const partner_1_address ="[put here your ganache account[1] ]"
const partner_2_address ="[put here your ganache account[2] ]"

const member_1_address = "[put here your ganache account[3] ]"
const member_2_address = "[put here your ganache account[4] ]"
```

> How to run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/felipecembranelli/blockchain-rewards.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

> Then in your browser go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)


> How to issue more tokens

Run the following script. It is simulating the token issues that could be done automatically in a pre-defined period of time (ex: monthly):

``truffle exec ./scripts/issue-token.js``

## To be done

There are a bunch of things that I would like to do:

- Implement a reconciliation logic inside the smart contract. Currently there is no logic implemented.
- Create administrator section on the application
- Create web page to allow administrator to issue tokens (earning process). Currently this function is executed via truffle scripts.
- Create web page to allow administrator to register new partners. Currently this function is executed via truffle scripts.
- Allow partners to check their balances
